This project showcases my frontend development skills by transforming a static PSD design into a clean, responsive web page. It focuses on:
- **Responsive layout** optimized for all screen sizes.
- Clean, semantic **HTML5** structure.
- Modern **CSS3** styling and layout techniques.
- Organized and scalable code for easy maintenance.
